gwt/java/website

GWT is a tool to use java alll the way to develop a website;
use google datastore or google cloud sql;
or connect to mysql for testing locally;
can upload to google engine server;
this is a great website;
I will update when I have time;

will not suggest to use GWT if we are familiar with PHP/HTML/CSS/JSP;
but very fun to learn;
